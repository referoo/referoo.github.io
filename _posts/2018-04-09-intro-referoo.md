title:  "Introducing Referoo"

The goal of  [Referoo](http://referoo.org) is to be an amazingly
user-friendly web portal for managing
the refereeing tasks of researchers. The portal will be designed in
such a way as to encourage referees to perform their duties
conscientiously and efficiently, and provide them with clear
incentives.

Because right now, being an anonymous referee is a thankless job.
Referees are asked to peer-review articles, often anonymously, using
some cumbersome publisher web interface. Once the job is done, the
most they get is a confidential thank you note. Rarely, the
reviewer gets notified of the outcome of their work.
They do not, in general, receive the final version of the article incorporating
their feedback.
Of course, referees do get some personal satisfaction from contributing to
their field, and from having a first peek at the latest discoveries. But
they get very little actual recognition and respect for the
tremendeous and crucial work they accomplish. 

And this causes significant problems for the other actors of the publication
process. Editors have a very hard time getting referees to agree to review
papers, or to send their reviews in a timely manner. Authors have to
wait forever to get their papers reviewed and published.

Referees are also getting very little in terms of tools, service and
convenience to do their job, while several
systems exist tailored to the needs of editors (OJS), conference
PC members (Easychair) and authors (ORCID, Researchgate).
[Referoo](http://referoo.org) intends to fill this gap.
At the same time, the portal will implement tools to avoid
the inefficiencies and the work duplication of the usual refereeing
process. 

While mainly focused on supporting referees, the portal will provide
benefits to all other actors of the scientific community. For journal
editors and conference organizers, the portal will contribute a more
efficient way to find willing and qualified referees, and a better way
to communicate with them. For authors, the portal will provide tools
to manage their list of publications automatically and accurately. The
portal will also inherently encourage the early diffusion of articles
on open access preprint servers.

Through the continuous evolution of the portal and other tools that
will be developed, the long term goal of this project is to empower
the scientific community to transition towards better and more
efficient publication models.
