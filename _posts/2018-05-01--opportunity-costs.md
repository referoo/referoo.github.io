title:  "The opportunity costs of redundant refereeing"

Although there are no direct costs associated with refereeing tasks of
researchers, those tasks incur significant _opportunity costs_. 
Time is the most precious ressource for a researcher, and refereeing
an article requires their full attention for several hours, time which
could otherwise have been spent on original research projects. 

Estimating the value of the opportunity costs of redundant refereeing
is difficult as most refereeing is done anonymously and
confidentially. 
A referee spends on average  over 4 hours to review a
paper (1).
An hour of work from a reviewer costs at least 20 Euros (2), 
therefore the cost of one review should be well over 80
Euros. Submitted articles require an average of 2.5 reviews [1], thus the
average cost of the reviews for a submission is over 200 Euros.

About [2.5 million articles are published every
year worldwide](http://www.scimagojr.com/worldreport.php). 
Weller [3] estimates that 21.6% of all published
papers were previously rejected. 
So out of 2.5 million published articles yearly, at least 500,000 went
through the refereeing process at least twice. 
This of course ignores the large number of articles that were
rejected multiple times and those that were never published. Rejection
rates of journals vary greatly by field and journal quality, between
19% and 90%. Also in fields (such as Computer Science) where it is
customary to submit the 
same article both to refereed conferences and journals, nearly every
article go through the refereeing process twice. For instance,
[over 150,000 articles are published every year in
Computer Science](http://www.scimagojr.com/worldreport.php?area=1700).

The opportunity costs
of this work duplication is thus likely well over 100 million Euros per
year. Reducing even a small fraction of this duplication would have a
considerable impact.

Several proposals have been made to solve the peer-review duplication
problem. One such proposal was to make reviews portable between
journals through mutual agreements. One notable example is the
[Neuroscience Peer Review Consortium](http://nprc.incf.org/),
which allows an author to forward
articles rejected from one journal of the consortium to another.
[Other similar consortiums](http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2013/07/15/game-of-papers-elife-bmc-plos-and-embo-announce-new-peer-review-consortium/) have been setup since then, most of them
limited to a restricted group of editors or to a field.
[Axios review](http://axiosreview.org/), 2013--2017, was another such
initiative. Authors submitted their article through the Axios website to a
list of journals, reviews were collected by Axios review and the
article was then submitted along with its reviews to the journals on
the list. Axios then collected a fee for each successfully published
article. Unfortunately the system did not succeed in attracting enough
submissions.
[Peerage of science](https://www.peerageofscience.org/) is
a similar initiative that proposes authors to get their articles
pre-reviewed on their system before submitting to a participating journal. The
website provides no statistics indicating how succesful they are.
The most recent article advertised on their website was published in 2016.

All those initiatives, while valuable, are limited to individual
agreements with certain journals, and give no significant incentive to
authors to actually forward reviews if they were negative.
[Other recent initiatives](https://doi.org/10.6087/kcse.2014.1.9) aim
to significantly reform the peer-review process.
However, as the most prestigious publication venues are often the most
ancient and traditional ones, any solution that would require changing
the existing peer-review process of the journal is likely to encounter
significant resistance.

Transfering referee reports will be a central feature of
[Referoo.org](http://referoo.org), while  maintaining strict
confidentiality standards. And since [Referoo](http://referoo.org) can
be used by the referees and editors of all journals and publishers, no
special agreements or consortiums are necessary. All actors of the
publication process are free to use this feature or not. Authors can
forward their [Referoo](http://referoo.org) paper ID during their next
submission to forward data about their previous submissions, editors
get valuable information that they can choose to use to expedite the
refereeing process, and referees always get to decide if their
information is transmitted. And everyone will get a quantitative assessment
of how much work they have accomplished and how much work duplication
they have helped avoid. 

### Footnotes
(1) Tenopir and King (2000) [1]
estimate that a researcher needs 3 to 6 hours of continuous work to
review a paper. The more recent study from the Publishing Research
Consortium [2] reports an average of 8.5 hours per
review, with a median of 5. Therefore 4 is a conservative estimate.

(2) The average annual salary of a researcher in Europe before taxes is
[over 50000 Euros](http://www. eurosfaire.prd.fr/7pc/mobility/).
A year contains about 250 business days, and each business day no more than 10 hours of work on average.
